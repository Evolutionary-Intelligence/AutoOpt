```AutoOptLib``` is a MATLAB library for automatically designing metaheuristic optimization algorithms. It leverages computing resources to replace human experts to conceive, build up, and verify the design choices of metaheuristic algorithms, subsequently producing algorithms that are fit for solving a targeted optimization problem. 

Human experts are not necessary during the design process. Therefore, ```AutoOptLib``` could make high-performance algorithms accessible to a much broader range of researchers and practitioners. Furthermore, by leveraging computing power to fully explore the design choices, ```AutoOptLib``` could reach or surpass human-level design, thereby gaining enhanced performance compared with human problem-solving. 

A comprehensive introduction to ```AutoOptLib``` can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06536).
